## About
In this project, an unconventional approach is used to find solutions to the generalized version of the [Eight-queens puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) - the _n-queens puzzle_. That is, placing `n` queens on an `n Ã— n` chessboard such that no two queens are threatening each other. This problem has been previously solved using [backtracking depth-first searches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) or efficient analytically-derived algorithms. The results of this notebook show it is possible to find a single solution to the n-queens problem for moderate values of `n` (up to `n = 64`, a `10^90` search space) by using evolutionary algorithms and genetic programming.
